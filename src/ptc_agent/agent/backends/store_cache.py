"""Per-request store cache shared between memory/memo middleware + backends.

Background
----------
On every model call the agent runs ``MemoryContextMiddleware`` (two ``aget``
calls — user + workspace ``memory.md``) and ``MemoAwarenessMiddleware`` (one
``aget`` for the memo catalog row). A 3-tool-call turn pays 9 store reads
before the model body runs, on data that is identical round-to-round in 99%
of turns. This cache deduplicates those reads to one set per turn.

Lifecycle
---------
A fresh cache is constructed per ``PTCAgent.create_agent`` call. Because one
agent is built per request (see ``agent.py`` invariant), the cache is
request-scoped: it never bridges users or turns. Writes through
``StoreBackend.awrite_text`` / ``aedit_text`` invalidate the affected
key so the next middleware read sees the fresh value within the same turn.

Bounds
------
Per turn the cache holds at most ~5 entries (two memory tiers + memo catalog
+ a couple of agent-side memory writes). No eviction policy is needed at
this size; the cache is dropped with the agent instance.

    """Tiny ``aget`` cache shared by middleware + backend within one agent.

    Only ``aget`` lookups are cached. ``asearch`` and write paths bypass the
    cache deliberately: the search-results payload is heavy and rarely
    repeats, and writes go straight to the store followed by an
    ``invalidate`` so future reads observe the new value.

    Concurrent ``aget`` for the same key shares one in-flight ``Task`` so
    parallel middleware (e.g. user + workspace memory loaded in
    ``asyncio.gather``) cannot fan out N store calls for the same row.

    Not safe to share across event loops or asyncio tasks that outlive the
    agent run; the agent runs single-threaded on one loop.
