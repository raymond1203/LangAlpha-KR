          <Section title="1. Introduction">
            <p>
              LangAlpha is an AI-powered financial research platform. This Privacy Policy
              describes what information we collect when you use the hosted LangAlpha service,
              how we use it, who we share it with, and the choices you have. By using the
              hosted service, you agree to the practices described here.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Scope:</strong> This policy applies only to the hosted LangAlpha service
              operated at <code>ginlix.ai</code> and <code>langalpha.com</code> (and their
              related subdomains). LangAlpha&apos;s core agent code is open source. If you
              self-host LangAlpha or run it from the source repository, this policy does not
              apply to your deployment — you (or the operator of that deployment) are
              responsible for data handling, and the third-party providers you configure are
              governed by their own terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              LangAlpha is currently operated as an independent project. If you have questions
              about this policy or your data, contact us at{' '}

          <Section title="2. Information We Collect">
            <p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>
                <strong>Account information</strong> — your name, email address, and profile
                information from OAuth providers (Google, GitHub) when you sign up.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Conversation data</strong> — the messages you send to the AI agent,
                the agent&apos;s responses, and the history of your threads and workspaces.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Workspace data</strong> — files, code, and outputs you create inside
                your isolated workspace environment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage data</strong> — which features you use and how often, in
                aggregated and anonymized form, used to improve the product.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Technical data</strong> — IP address, browser type, device
                information, and diagnostic logs needed to operate the service securely.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </Section>

          <Section title="3. How We Use Your Information">
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the LangAlpha service.</li>
              <li>
                To improve LangAlpha through anonymized, aggregated analytics.{' '}
                <strong>
                  We do not use your conversations to train AI models.
                </strong>
              </li>
              <li>To prevent fraud, abuse, and security incidents.</li>
              <li>
                To communicate with you about service updates, changes, and support
                requests.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </Section>

          <Section title="4. AI Processing and Third-Party Model Providers">
            <p>
              When you send a message to the LangAlpha agent, your message and related context
              are processed by third-party large language model (LLM) providers so they can
              generate a response. We route queries to a variety of providers, which may
              include (non-exhaustively): Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), Google (Gemini),
              Alibaba Cloud DashScope (Qwen), ByteDance Volcengine (Doubao), DeepSeek, Z.AI
              (GLM), MiniMax, Moonshot (Kimi), Groq, and Cerebras. Some of these providers
              host their infrastructure outside your country of residence, including in the
              United States and mainland China. The specific set of providers and models may
              change over time as we add or remove support.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Bring Your Own Key (BYOK):</strong> If you configure your own API key
              for a provider, your queries are sent directly to that provider using your key
              and are governed by your agreement with them. In that case LangAlpha acts only
              as a conduit for your requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each provider processes your queries under its own terms and privacy policy.
              Commercial API terms at major providers generally prohibit using API inputs to
              train their foundation models, but you should review the privacy policy of any
              provider you use for details. AI-generated output is not financial, legal, or
              investment advice.

          </Section>

          <Section title="5. Code Execution and Sandboxes">
            <p>
              LangAlpha executes code in isolated sandbox environments on your behalf to
              perform data analysis and generate visualizations. Sandboxes are currently
              provided by{' '}

                Daytona
              </a>
              . Each sandbox is tied to your workspace and isolated from other users. Files
              you create in a sandbox persist within that workspace until you delete them or
              delete the workspace.

          <Section title="6. Financial Data">
            <p>
              LangAlpha retrieves public market data (such as prices, fundamentals, news,
              and filings) from third-party data providers on your behalf. The specific
              providers may change over time. This data is displayed for informational and
              research purposes only.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>
                LangAlpha does not connect to your bank, brokerage, or personal financial
                accounts, and we do not collect your personal financial records.

          </Section>

          <Section title="7. Data Sharing">
            <p>We do not sell your personal data. We share information only with:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>
                <strong>LLM providers</strong> — to process your queries and generate
                responses (see Section 4).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Authentication</strong> — Supabase manages account sign-in, session

              <li>
                <strong>Sandbox execution</strong> — Daytona runs code generated on your
                behalf (see Section 5).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Search and web data</strong> — when the agent browses the web on
                your behalf, your query is sent to search or fetch providers such as Tavily
                and Serper.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Market data providers</strong> — to retrieve public financial data

              </li>
              <li>

            <p>
              We retain your account data for as long as your account is active. Conversation
              threads and workspace files are retained until you delete them or delete your

              app.
